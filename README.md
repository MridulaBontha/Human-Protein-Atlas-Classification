# Human-Protein-Atlas-Classification


Proteins are a vital part of human cellular system. Localizing proteins at a diseased bodyâ€™s cellular level could help in understanding the biological phenomena and functions causing the disease. High Throughput fluorescence microscopic Imaging also known as HTI is a frugal and affordable way of localizing proteins. This technique takes microscopic pictures of proteins of interest by staining them with fluorescent antibodies. Human Protein Atlas project has taken initiative of labeling such images, thus providing a opulent source of information which could be very well harnessed by the power of computational analytics such as Deep Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs). CNN is very powerful machine learning model to perform classification of images. We have implemented CNN using pre-trained network- InceptionV3, from scratch using Conv2d layers and also GapNet-PL for localizing proteins in human body cell. We have also carried out fine-parameter tuning of different models and performed comprehensive comparisons between above models.
